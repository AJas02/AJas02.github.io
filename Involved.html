    <p> The opportunity gap in our country's education system is not going to close itself. Here are some things you can do to support the nation's youth: </p>

   <h3>DONATE</h3>
    
    <p> Donate to organizations that provide educational support to children who have limited access, such as
    <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/donate"> Khan Academy</a> , which provides free educational resources for students and teachers, or 
      <a href= "https://girlswhocode.com/shop/product/donation/"> Girls Who Code </a>, which aims to close the gender gap by educating women in technology and coding.
    </p>

    <img src= "email.jpg" alt="picture of cartoon envelopes flying out of a laptop">
	<p> Write to your local or state-level officials asking them to support reforms that provide funding to schools and teachers in low-income neighborhoods. Funding for schools often comes from property taxes, which means that affluent neighborhoods, where the taxes are higher, often receive much more funding for education. This means more resources and opportunities for those students. In areas where property taxes do not provide enough money, our lawmakers should budget more for these students. </p>

    <h2> "Often our school system perpetuates the social divide it's supposed to fix" </h2>

    <p> In the United States, the educational divide is only growing. Minorities and children from low-income households receive fewer opportunities and are less likely to finish high school. Those that do are less likely than their peers to graduate or even attend college. In addition, gender discrimination in schools continues to be an issue, as young women are discouraged from education in certain fields, such as STEM. This divide is not caused by the students themselves, many of whom are trapped in a cycle that they are trying to escape. All children deserve a high-quality education, including more resources for success in all levels of education, more affordable options for higher education, and opportunity for all students in all fields regardless of their gender, race, or socioeconomic status.</p>
